- Logging :

	- Monitoring a kubernetes cluster:

		- Monitor node level metrics, cpu, memory, disk consumption and the Pod level metrics.

		- Heapter is depricted and now we use Metrics Server. Metrics server is an in memory monitoring solutions.
		- Kubelet contains cAdvisor which retrieves peformance metrics from the pods and expose them through the Kubelet API and make it available to the Metrics Server.
		- You need to install the Metrics server explicitly.

		# git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics-server
		# kubectl create -f deploy/1.8/

		- To view the performance of pod and nodes
		
		# kubectl top node
		# kubectl top pod


	- Managing Application logs.

		- Logging docker running on kubernetes.

			- If a pod contains a single docker.

				# kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod


			- If a pod contains multiple docker containers.

				#kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod  pod-name-1
